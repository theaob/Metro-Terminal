Data2Serial Metro
=================

Data2Serial is a serial port communicator, a **terminal** of some sorts. Designed primarily for embedded system testing, main purpose is to sending text files faster as strings or byte arrays.

Working with serial ports doesn't mean that you have to use ugly interfaced terminals.

This is the metrofied version of [Data2Serial2](https://github.com/theaob/Data2Serial2).

This project uses these projects:
[MahApps.Metro](https://github.com/mahapps/mahapps.metro/) for Metro UI.
[Extended WPF Toolkit](http://wpftoolkit.codeplex.com/) for WPF Color Picker and Update Window Busy Indicator
